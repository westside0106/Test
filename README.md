# Domain Directory Tool

This repository contains a small command line tool for maintaining a
list of domains and related metadata. Domains can be added manually or
loaded from text, CSV or XLSX files. The tool attempts to fetch basic
information using a WHOIS lookup. If network access is not available,
fields remain empty so they can be filled in manually.

Run the script with `--help` for usage instructions.
